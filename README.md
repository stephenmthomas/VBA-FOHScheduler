# VBA-FOHScheduler
Fully includsive macro enabled Excel worksheet that generates an employee work schedule.  Developed for management while I was a bar tender at a local pub.  Excel worksheet includes everything, but just the code is in the *.vb file.  Uses a brute enumeration method to general lists of requirements on the fly from worksheets, and then fills the schedule accordingly. Includes idiot-proofing and other expected features.
